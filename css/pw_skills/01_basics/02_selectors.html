    <!-- We should not be using one id for more than one elements. 

    But if we give both the id and class to an element, the browser would priortize the id over the class.
    
    This isbecause id is more 'specific' than class.

    
    Specifity in CSS means which property would have more priority.
    
    What is more specific, will be given more priority, Like in this case id is more specific than class.
